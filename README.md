# Stacks Nakamoto Block Simulator

A Stacks block simulator and visualization tool, with educational purposes

## :warning: :warning: This repository is under heavy development :warning: :warning:

The code is still in a experimental state. As soon as the domain is more clear, a lot of moving and renaming will start happening.

## Introduction

The Stacks blockchain is about to undergo a series of transformative changes that will take its integration into the Bitcoin chain one step further. Those changes, collectively known as the Stacks Nakamoto Release, together with sBTC, will bring Stacks' smart contracts the ability to write to the Bitcoin blockchain, combined with the already present capacity to read from it.

The Stacks Nakamoto release proposes changes to Stacks' consensus algorithm, significantly affecting its security model. Those changes are sometimes challenging to understand. Because of that, the Stacks community is building an interactive tool to help educate its community members and others on how the new consensus algorithm will work. We're calling this tool the Stacks Nakamoto Simulator, and you're looking at it's official repository.

## Design

Notice that the implementation will differ in many places.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). You can learn more about it in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
