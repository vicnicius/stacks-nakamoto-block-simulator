In the last week, I worked on exploring the UI and UX of the simulator on Figma. The idea is to have a well-defined design direction before I start coding. The Figma files are published as a community project here:

[Stacks Nakamoto Simulator Design](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1232702064747014163)

For the coming week, the plan is to get some good feedback on the prototype and start coding.
