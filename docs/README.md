### Introduction

The Stacks blockchain is about to undergo a series of transformative changes that will take its integration into the Bitcoin chain one step further. Those changes, collectively known as [the Stacks Nakamoto release](https://stacks.org/sbtc-nakamoto), together with [sBTC](https://stx.is/sbtc-pdf), will bring Stacks' smart contracts the ability to write to the Bitcoin blockchain, combined with the already present capacity to read from it.

The Stacks Nakamoto release proposes changes to Stacks' consensus algorithm, significantly affecting its security model. Those changes are sometimes challenging to understand. Because of that, the Stacks community is building an interactive tool to help educate its community members and others on how the new consensus algorithm will work. We're calling this tool the Stacks Nakamoto Simulator.

In the following pages, you'll find the technical and user documentation for this tool and related supporting material.

**Disclaimer:** This project is part of the Stacks Foundation grant program. On the next page, you'll find detailed information related to it.&#x20;
