# Design

UI and UX play an essential role in this project. We're using Figma to design, collect feedback on the project design, and help guide its implementation. Everyone is encouraged to try out the prototypes, give input, fork and try their takes and ideas. Some things to keep in mind while doing so:

1. Constructive feedback is always welcome. And it's good when it focuses on the problems rather than possible solutions.
2. Make your input exhaustive whenever possible. Since most communication in open projects like this is asynchronous, covering as much as possible on each iteration is good.
3. Make it objective. Keep the project's design goals in mind, and let everyone know why you think certain parts are off the mark.
